# class-scheduler-version-1
Class scheduler program, version 1 (basic skeleton, proof of concept)

This program is a Python script that parses a file with different courses and their information (course name, course number, and course meeting times for each section of the course), and generates all possible schedules of those courses that do not have any conflictiing meeting times between classes.

This script is meant only as a proof-of-concept, with very basic functionality. The input consists of a .txt file with course information. The output consists of a .txt file containing lists of course names/course numbers, and the section number. Each list represents 1 possible schedule. The output is not very informative of what each schedule would look like. 

Some of the data structures used in this script (queue, heap, etc.) are implementations from a Data Structures and Algorithms course taken at college.
